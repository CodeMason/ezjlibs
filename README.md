A collection of useful Java / Processing libraries.

ezGestures
ezGestures is a gesture recognition library for Processing. It works by analyzing mouse or Wiimote movements while dragging, and comparing the motion against a regular expression to find a match. It was originally developed for tweetPad, but has been modified into a more general version for plugging into any project.
